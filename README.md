# React Starting Point

This is just a starting point to let us use gulp to set up a ReactJS front end.

## Installation

First, clone the repository

`git clone git@github.com:RoundtableDevelopment/react-frontend-starting-point.git`

Then, `cd react-frontend-starting-point`, run `bower install` and `npm install`.  These will probably take a minute.

## Usage

To get started, just run `gulp`.  It will automatically compile everything in the /src directory, start a server, and open your web browser.  Because we've got BrowserSync, anytime you save a change to an image, sass file, or javascript file, the page will automatically reload.  Yowza!

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
